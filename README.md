# Hyper_Spectral_Anomaly_Detection
The HSA is a statistics-based anomaly detection model that uses graph theory to analyze data relationships across time and scale. It works on diverse data types—such as cybersecurity, materials testing, and GIS—providing unsupervised detection of unusual patterns while reducing false positives with a multi-filter process.
